# Volleyball+ App

##### General
This is my Volleyball+ app directly pushed from the IntelliJ Idea IDE.
The .gitignore is unchanged, I think they know better what they are doing.

### Description
This is an Android app (API30: Android 10.0+ (R)).
The app in its first version is simply for keeping track of the score of an Volleyball game.
