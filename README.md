# The further developement of this is stopped!
This is due to a drastic change in the app's architecture. I'm a beginner and I leanred about MVVM. Also the core of the app: the game class
has to be completely redone anyway for the features I wanted the app to have. Sorry. But look at the AutomaticScorer app, this is the successor of the Volleyball+ app!

## Volleyball+ App

##### General
This is my Volleyball+ app directly pushed from the IntelliJ Idea IDE.
The .gitignore is unchanged, I think they know better what they are doing.

### Description
This is an Android app (API30: Android 10.0+ (R)).
The app in its first version is simply for keeping track of the score of an Volleyball game.

### Features

###### Already implemented
* Count score of the teams with a simple reverse option if you misclicked or the referee made a mistake.
* Set the names of the teams and the winning score as well as point gaps and the number of sets a team needs to win for a victory
* create your own settings
* choose from a settings templates

###### This will not come, but in it the app's sucessor: AutomaticScorer
* You are playing with the rules of the DVV? Use the Spielberichtsbogen-feature to reduce the mistakes made in the Spielberichtsbogen and avoid fines and penalties!
